# Dam-Gate-Automation

### Project Objectives
1. Design and implement a cost-effective water level monitoring system using
jumper-based sensors capable of detecting at least 5 distinct water levels
with 95% accuracy.
2. Develop and train an AI model that can predict potential flood events with
at least 80% accuracy based on real-time and historical weather data.
3. Design a servo motor operated dam gate control system capable of changing
position of gates on recipient of the command.
4. Include a real-time alarm function that can send a SMS notification to key
stakeholders after recognizing crucial conditions.
5. Create an integrated control firmware on the ESP32 platform that is
capable of integrating sensor information, prediction using AI models, and
mechanical actuation.
6. Test the systemâ€™s performance thoroughly under different simulated
weather and water level conditions to validate its effectiveness.
7. Document the implementation process, costs, and benefits to facilitate
replication in similar contexts across different regions
